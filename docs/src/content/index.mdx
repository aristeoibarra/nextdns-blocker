title: NextDNS Blocker
description: Automated, schedule-based domain blocking built on the NextDNS API
---

NextDNS Blocker is a command-line tool that automates domain blocking using the NextDNS API.  
It enables **time-based access control**, **friction-based unblock delays**, and **emergency lockdown modes**—all enforced automatically.

## Overview

While NextDNS provides powerful DNS-level blocking, managing schedules and access rules manually can be repetitive and error-prone.  
NextDNS Blocker automates this process by continuously enforcing your rules based on time, intent, and configuration.

## Core Capabilities

- **Per-domain scheduling**  
  Define when specific domains should be accessible.

- **Automatic enforcement**  
  A watchdog synchronizes rules with NextDNS every few minutes.

- **Unblock delays**  
  Introduce friction to prevent impulsive access.

- **Emergency panic mode**  
  Instantly block all configured domains when needed.

- **Cross-platform support**  
  Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows.

## Who is this for?

NextDNS Blocker is designed for users who want:

- Fine-grained, schedule-based control over internet access
- Automated enforcement without manual toggling
- Stronger digital discipline through intentional friction
- A scriptable, CLI-first workflow
